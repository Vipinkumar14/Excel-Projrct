### Number of Cars

#### Key Findings

   - Higher likelihood of bike purchase when there are no cars owned: A bike purchase rate of approximately 36.8%.
   
2. *One Car Owned*
   - A total of 106 individuals (38 purchased, 68 did not purchase).
   - 35.8% of individuals with one car owned purchased a bike, indicating a relatively strong inclination towards bike purchases in this group.

5. *Four or More Cars Owned*
   - A total of 48 individuals (17 purchased, 31 did not purchase).
  
### Commute Distance

1. *0-1 Miles*
   - A significant number of individuals who commute a shorter distance between 0-1 miles have purchased bikes. This implies that shorter commuting distances may encourage bike purchases, possibly due to ease of commuting or avoiding traffic.

2. *1-2 Miles*
   - Many people commuting 1-2 miles also tend to purchase bikes, although slightly less than the 0-1 mile group. Biking within this commute distance is still quite convenient for quick travel.

3. *2-5 Miles*
   - There is a noticeable drop in bike purchases for commutes of 2-5 miles. While still within biking distance, it may be less appealing for daily commuters, considering other modes of transport could be preferred over longer distances.

4. *5-10 Miles*
   - Fewer individuals commuting 5-10 miles purchase bikes, suggesting that this distance may be less practical for regular bike commuting, possibly due to the effort required to bike over longer distances or the availability of alternative transportation methods.

5. *10+ Miles*
   - There are very few to no recorded purchases among those with commutes over 10 miles. This distance is generally less feasible for regular bike commuting, making bikes a less preferred option for practical reasons.
